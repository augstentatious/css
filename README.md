# Confessional Safety Stack
We present the Confessional Safety Stack (CSS), an inference-time safety architecture that integrates a trauma-informed interrupt layer, a Bayesian multi- metric risk aggregator, and a private recursive introspection module. CSS detects and preempts emergent harms (e.g., coercive enmeshment and deceptive reasoning) that evade post-hoc classifiers.
